The goal of this assignment is to make a causal statement on how the variables in a (very) small dataset are related to one another (11 variables). In this report, we apply the PC method from Spirtes et al., an algorithm to identify the causal structure in graphs from sample probabilities. This causal discovery method is used to discover causal relations by analyzing statistical properties of purely observational data. The PC algorithm under i.i.d. sampling assuming no latent confounders uses a search architecture that involves plugging in statistical decision procedures to determine conditional independence. The algorithm works by forming a complete undirected graph, eliminating unconditionally independent edges, and then using a series of rules to orient edges and recover the true Markov Equivalence Class of the directed acyclic graph. The output of the PC algorithm is typically more informative than the conditional independence graph (Lauritzen et al.), as it has a causal interpretation and may differ from the estimated conditional independence graph. The PC algorithm is feasible for sparse graphs with at least tens of thousands of variables (even though this is not the case for our dataset), assuming efficient conditional independence tests.
